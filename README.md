## NYC-Bus-Tracker
Never be late again. 

#  Version 1: MTA Bus Application 
The goal of version 1 is to deliver a MVP 
Future iterations will include things like making the application cross platform and adding data analysis to predict bus delays.

# User case: 
1. user should be able to go to front page.
2. User will select the bus line they are interested on. 
3. User selects a bus station and press enter.
4. Bus data will be displayed.

# Technology Stack: 

I will be using AngularJS in the front end.(client side) 

MTA bus API will be used in the backend in order to get the data from the client's server.

Cassandra database in order to keep record of  station options.

# Agile Methodology
This app will be created using an agile Methodology. I will be using Jet Brains YouTrack in order to keep track of each sprint.
